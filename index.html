        <p class="para">  Hello, I am Tammy Kay, an Avon representative operating in the Conroe, Texas, area. I've lived in Conroe, Texas, for over 15 years. I have 4 children and 4 wonderful grandchildren. I use Avon products daily for myself and my family. We all enjoy the benefits of using Avon products, even my son and the hubby. My daughter uses them for her two sons for bathtime and other purposes. </p>
	    <p class="para">The grandbabies especially love the long-lasting and durable toys that Avon provides. Most don't know it, but Avon really does have a lot of toys based on popular child shows and movies, such as Paw Patrol, Barbie, and Avengers.</p>
	    <p class="para">This certainly is not your grandmother's Avon. Avon has come a long way since I was a child. It's not just makeup and perfume. It's independence; satisfaction that you can make a good buck while having fun with beauty products! </p>
	    <p class="para">  I offer makeup, perfume, clothing and similar accessories, and skin products. Skin So Soft products have improved over the years, with different scents, and they are not just for bath time any longer. You can use it outside for BugGuard, and you can use it on your pets and children alike, as it is safe and effective; not to mention affordable. Avon Techniques' shampoo is a particular favorite of mine, as I use it daily with my shower. It's gentle enough to use every day without that pesky buildup in your hair. You'll find most of Avon's products are just as high quality. For children going back to school, we have tea-tree oil products to deter lice, keeping your kids and family safe, with the same gentleness as from many of Avon's lines. Other back-to-school products include clothes, backpacks, shoes, etc. </p>
	    <p class="para">Check out my Avon page for daily discounts, coupon codes, free shipping, and an assortment of daily offers. Follow my social media accounts so you will be notified of any Avon offers. Send me a friend request on my Avon FaceBook page to be notified of deals on FaceBook! Follow my Instagram to see pictures of great products and offers! You may want to consider becoming an Avon representative and earning money back on your own purchases, as I have done for the last few years.</p>
	    <p class="para"> Thank you for checking out my page! You will enjoy the products as much as we do, I assure you that! </p>
	    <h2 class="sig" style="font-family : cursive">Sincerely, Tammy Kay</h2>
